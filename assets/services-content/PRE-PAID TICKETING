PRE-PAID TICKETING.

Pre-paid ticketing basically refers to a ticket paid-for in one location for traveling from another location.
When a prepaid ticket advice (PTA) is issued to be picked up,
a ticket bought by the buyer at his/her current location, will then  allow him/her to make a travel from a different location. The issuance of a prepaid ticket advice (PTA) aids buyers to pick up prepaid tickets, after depositing money on the account and we keep issuing tickets accordingly.

Disclaimer
PTA (Pre-paid Ticket Advice)
This is basically a form issued by your travel agency after buying a ticket that will be issued at the Airport either in the same city or another city for which the passenger is travelling to or from.
