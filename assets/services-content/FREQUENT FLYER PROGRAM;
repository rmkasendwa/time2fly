FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM;
Frequent flyer program refers to a loyalty program offered by the airline.
Many airlines have frequent flyer programs designed to encourage airline passengers enroll in the program to accumulate points/miles which may be redeemed for air travel and other rewards. 
Points earned under frequent flyer program may be based on the class of fare, distance travelled on that airline and the amount paid. 
Airlines benefit more from this program and so they prefer giving some services to the frequent travelers.
The best way of obtaining points is to fly with the associated airline, using co-branded credit and debit cards among others.

Disclaimer
These programs are free and easy to sign up for. And despite the general term â€œfrequent flyer," you don't need to be one. You can sign up online while booking your first flight. Then, enter your frequent flyer number when you buy tickets so that you'll earn reward miles or points.
