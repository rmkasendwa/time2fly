CHARTER ARRANGEMENTS;
Chartering is an activity within the travel industry whereby a carrier owner hires out the use of his vessel to a charterer. The contract between the parties is called a charter party. 
There are 3 main types of charter arrangements;
A demise charter, or bareboat charter;
Basically an arrangement for the hiring of a vessel 	whereby no administration or technical maintenance is 	included as part of the agreement.
A voyage charter;
This refers to the hiring of a vessel and crew for a voyage between a load port and a discharge port. The charterer pays the vessel owner on a per-ton or lump-sum basis.
A time charter;
In this kind of arrangement, the hiring of a vessel for a specific period of time; the owner still manages the vessel but the charterer selects the ports and directs the vessel where to go.
